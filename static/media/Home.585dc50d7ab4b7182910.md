Our team competes in the annual Design/Build/Fly competition hosted by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Throughout the year the team designs, prototypes, manufactures, and tests in order to develop a successful radio-controlled aircraft that best meets the mission requirements and constraints of the competition. Our members gain real-world design and manufacturing experience while develop long-lasting connections with one another.

Our team is divided into three sub-teams: Aerodynamics, Systems, and Structures. Our leadership is currently composed of 7 positions: Project Manager, Chief Aero Design Engineer, Chief Systems Design Engineer, Aerodynamics Lead, Structures Lead, Manufacturing Lead, and Treasurer.
