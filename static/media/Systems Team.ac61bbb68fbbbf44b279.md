## Telemetry System

The TeLIC (Telemetry Logger and Illumination Controller) is a PCB shield designed for the Arduino Uno R3, crafted with KiCad for seamless integration and enhanced functionality. This advanced shield logs an extensive range of parameters including current, voltage, GPS coordinates, airspeed, control inputs, 6-axis gyro measurements, air pressure, and temperature. It supports dual data management options, allowing users to either store the information on an integrated SD card or transmit it via a HOTT telemetry connector for real-time analysis. Additionally, the TeLIC features a dedicated port for controlling ARGB LEDs, dynamically adjusting the illumination based on the telemetry data, making it a versatile tool for comprehensive telemetry and system monitoring applications.
